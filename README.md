🎨 Project Title:
Recipe App – Angular Meal Finder (API Based)

✨ Project Overview:
This project is a fully responsive Angular-based Recipe Application that fetches and displays meal data from a public Meals API. The application allows users to browse meals, view detailed recipe information, and navigate seamlessly between different sections using Angular routing.

The project is structured using modular Angular components and focuses on clean UI, scalability, and real-world API integration.

The goal of the project is to:
... Practice real-world API integration using Angular 🍽️
... Display dynamic meal data with clean UI rendering 🔄
... Implement component-based architecture 🧩
... Learn Angular routing and state handling 📍
... Build a scalable frontend project structure 🚀

🛠️ Tech Stack:
... Angular – Frontend framework and application architecture
... TypeScript – Strongly typed JavaScript for maintainable code
... HTML5 – Component templates and semantic markup
... CSS3 / Global Styles – Styling and layout
... Angular Router – Navigation between pages
... HTTP Client Module – Fetching data from Meals API
... Public Meals API – Dynamic recipe and meal data

No backend or database is used; all data is fetched directly from the external API ⚡

🌟 Key Features:

Component-Based Architecture 🧩
• Modular folder structure (header, recipe-listing, recipe-details)
• Reusable and scalable Angular components
• Clean separation of UI and logic

API Integration & Dynamic Data 🔄
• Fetch meals data from external Meals API

# RecipeApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
